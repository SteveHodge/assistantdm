      <p>
         <span>The
subject can tread on air as if walking on solid ground. Moving upward is
similar to walking up a hill. The maximum upward or downward angle possible is
45 degrees, at a rate equal to one-half the air walker’s normal speed.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>A
strong wind (21+ mph) can push the subject along or hold it back. At the end of
its turn each round, the wind blows the air walker 5 feet for each 5 miles per
hour of wind speed. The creature may be subject to additional penalties in
exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control over movement
or physical damage from being buffeted about.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Should
the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails
slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it
reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls
the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since
dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way
if the <i>air walk </i>spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an <i>antimagic
field</i>.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
can cast <i>air walk </i>on a specially trained mount so it can be ridden
through the air. You can train a mount to move with the aid of <i>air walk </i>(counts
as a trick; see Handle Animal skill) with one week of work and a DC 25 Handle
Animal check.</span>

   <description>
      <p>
         <span>You
assume the form of a creature of the same type as your normal form. The new
form must be within one size category of your normal size. The maximum HD of an
assumed form is equal to your caster level, to a maximum of 5 HD at 5th level.
You can change into a member of your own kind or even into yourself.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
retain your own ability scores. Your class and level, hit points, alignment,
base attack bonus, and base save bonuses all remain the same. You retain all
supernatural and spell-like special attacks and qualities of your normal form,
except for those requiring a body part that the new form does not have (such as
a mouth for a breath weapon or eyes for a gaze attack).</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
keep all extraordinary special attacks and qualities derived from class levels,
but you lose any from your normal form that are not derived from class levels.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
the new form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally. You retain any
spellcasting ability you had in your original form, but the new form must be
able to speak intelligibly (that is, speak a language) to use verbal components
and must have limbs capable of fine manipulation to use somatic or material
components.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind.
Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as
burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum
speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor
bonus, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses,
racial bonus feats, and any gross physical qualities (presence or absence of
wings, number of extremities, and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not
allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than
normal.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
do not gain any extraordinary special attacks or special qualities not noted
above under physical qualities, such as darkvision, low-light vision,
blindsense, blindsight, fast healing, regeneration, scent, and so forth.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
do not gain any supernatural special attacks, special qualities, or spell-like
abilities of the new form. Your creature type and subtype (if any) remain the
same regardless of your new form. You cannot take the form of any creature with
a template, even if that template doesn’t change the creature type or subtype.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
can freely designate the new form’s minor physical qualities (such as hair
color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of
that kind. The new form’s significant physical qualities (such as height,
weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the
norms for the new form’s kind. You are effectively disguised as an average
member of the new form’s race. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you
get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>When
the change occurs, your equipment, if any, either remains worn or held by the
new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item), or melds into the
new form and becomes nonfunctional. When you revert to your true form, any
objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on
your body they previously occupied and are once again functional. Any new items
you wore in the assumed form and can’t wear in your normal form fall off and
land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part
common to both forms at the time of reversion are still held in the same way.
Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole
reverts to its true form.</span>

      <p>
         <span>A
number of animals grow to twice their normal size and eight times their normal
weight. This alteration changes each animal’s size category to the next
largest, grants it a +8 size bonus to Strength and a +4 size bonus to
Constitution (and thus an extra 2 hit points per HD), and imposes a −2 size
penalty to Dexterity. The creature’s existing natural armor bonus increases by
2. The size change also affects the animal’s modifier to AC and attack rolls
and its base damage. The animal’s space and reach change as appropriate to the
new size, but its speed does not change.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
spell also grants each subject damage reduction 10/magic and a +4 resistance
bonus on saving throws. If insufficient room is available for the desired
growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength
check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If
it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it— the
spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.</span>

cannot be one tamed or trained by someone else, including such creatures as
familiars and animal companions.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Using
some type of food desirable to the animal as a lure, you call the animal to
you. It advances and awaits your bidding. You can mentally impress on the
animal a certain place well known to you or an obvious landmark. The directions
must be simple, because the animal depends on your knowledge and can’t find a
destination on its own. You can attach some small item or note to the
messenger. The animal then goes to the designated location and waits there
until the duration of the spell expires, whereupon it resumes its normal
activities.</span>

remain in the animal form until the spell expires or until you dismiss it for
all recipients. In addition, an individual subject may choose to resume its
normal form as a full-round action; doing so ends the spell for that subject
alone. The maximum HD of an assumed form is equal to the subject’s HD or your

         <span>You
can animate a nonliving ropelike object. The maximum length assumes a rope with
a 1-inch diameter.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Reduce
the maximum length by 50% for every additional inch of thickness, and increase
it by 50% for each reduction of the rope’s diameter by half.</span>

         <span>The
possible commands are “coil” (form a neat, coiled stack), “coil and knot,”
“loop,” “loop and knot,” “tie and knot,” and the opposites of all of the above

      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
rope can enwrap only a creature or an object within 1 foot of it—it does not
snake outward—so it must be thrown near the intended target. Doing so requires
a successful ranged touch attack roll (range increment 10 feet). A typical 1-
inch-diameter hempen rope has 2 hit points, AC 10, and requires a DC 23
Strength check to burst it. The rope does not deal damage, but it can be used
as a trip line or to cause a single opponent that fails a Reflex saving throw
to become entangled. A creature capable of spellcasting that is bound by this
spell must make a DC 15 Concentration check to cast a spell. An entangled
creature can slip free with a DC 20 Escape Artist check.</span>

   <description>
      <p>
         <span>An
invisible barrier surrounds you and moves with you. The space within this
barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like
abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of
any magic items or spells within its confines.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>An
<i>antimagic field </i>suppresses any spell or magical effect used within,
brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. Time spent within
an <i>antimagic field </i>counts against the suppressed spell’s duration.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Summoned
creatures of any type and incorporeal undead wink out if they enter an <i>antimagic
field. </i>They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent
winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is
maintaining the creature. If you cast <i>antimagic field </i>in an area
occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a
caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature’s spell
resistance to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations<i> </i>are
not affected by an <i>antimagic field </i>because the conjuration itself is no
longer in effect, only its result.)</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>A
normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while
a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword
(and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other
constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are
thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they
are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, corporeal undead,
and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures’
spell-like or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by
the field. <i>Dispel magic </i>does not remove the field.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Two
or more <i>antimagic fields </i>sharing any of the same space have no effect on
each other. Certain spells, such as <i>wall of force, prismatic sphere</i>, and
<i>prismatic wall, </i>remain unaffected by <i>antimagic field </i>(see the
individual spell descriptions). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal
magic such as this. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Should
a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of it that
lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field.</span>

         <span>You
create an invisible magical sensor that sends you visual information. You can
create the <i>arcane eye </i>at any point you can see, but it can then travel
outside your line of sight without hindrance. An <i>arcane eye </i>travels at
30 feet per round (300 feet per minute) if viewing an area ahead as a human
would (primarily looking at the floor) or 10 feet per round (100 feet per
minute) if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. It sees

more quickly.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight. An aura’s
power depends on a spell’s functioning level or an item’s caster level, as
noted in the description of the <i>detect magic </i>spell. If the items or
creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill
checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per
aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + one-half caster level for a nonspell
effect.)</span>

         <span>If
you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard
action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like

         <span>By
freeing your spirit from your physical body, this spell allows you to project
an astral body onto another plane altogether.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that
these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting.
These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all
times. If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are
stranded wherever you left them.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body
behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation. The spell
projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane.
Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to
any of these other planes as you will. To enter one, you leave the Astral
Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence
you have chosen to enter.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>While
you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your
physical body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed,
astrally and physically. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord.
When a second body is formed on a different plane, the incorporeal silvery cord
remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral
form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the
Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation.
Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their
actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body
must be materialized on other planes.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely. Your
bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to
return your spirits to them. The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or
until it is terminated by some outside means, such as <i>dispel magic </i>cast
upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver
cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills
you).</span>

creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting
right its misdeeds. If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly
or under some form of compulsion, <i>atonement </i>operates normally at no cost
to you. However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds and
acts of a knowing and willful nature, you must intercede with your deity
(requiring you to expend 500 XP) in order to expunge the subject’s burden. Many
casters first assign a subject of this sort a quest (see <i>geas/quest</i>) or
similar penance to determine whether the creature is truly contrite before
casting the <i>atonement </i>spell on its behalf.</span>

or Temptation: </span>
         </i>
         <span>You
may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer
it a chance to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject
must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the spell,
the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or
acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion,
or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity
offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the spell
does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its alignment
naturally.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Though
the spell description refers to evil acts, <i>atonement </i>can also be used on
any creature that has performed acts against its alignment, whether those acts
are evil, good, chaotic, or lawful.</span>

         <i>
            <span>Note:

         <span>Normally,
changing alignment is up to the player. This use of <i>atonement </i>simply
offers a believable way for a character to change his or her alignment
drastically, suddenly, and definitively.</span>

         <span>An
<i>augury </i>can tell you whether a particular action will bring good or bad
results for you in the immediate future.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a
maximum of 90%; this roll is made secretly. A question may be so
straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or so vague as to have
no chance of success. If the <i>augury </i>succeeds, you get one of four
results:</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>· </span>
         <span>Weal (if the action will
probably bring good results).</span>

         <span>Nothing (for actions that
don’t have especially good or bad results).</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
the spell fails, you get the “nothing” result. A cleric who gets the “nothing”
result has no way to tell whether it was the consequence of a failed or
successful <i>augury.</i>
         </span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
<i>augury </i>can see into the future only about half an hour, so anything that
might happen after that does not affect the result. Thus, the result might not
take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action. All <i>auguries
</i>cast by the same person about the same topic use the same dice result as
the first casting.</span>

You change the subject into a Small or smaller animal of
no more than 1 HD (such as a dog, lizard, monkey, or
toad). The subject takes on all the statistics and special
abilities of an average member of the new form in place
of its own except as follows:</p>
      <p>With those exceptions, the target’s normal
game statistics are replaced by those of the new
form. The target loses all the special abilities it
has in its normal form, including its class
features.</p>
      <p>All items worn or carried by the subject fall to
the ground at its feet, even if they could be worn
or carried by the new form.</p>
      <p>If the new form would prove fatal to the
creature (for example, if you polymorphed a
landbound target into a fish, or an airborne
target into a toad), the subject gets a +4 bonus
on the save.</p>
      <p>If the subject remains in the new form for 24
consecutive hours, it must attempt a Will save.
If this save fails, it loses its ability to understand
language, as well as all other memories of its
previous form, and its Hit Dice and hit points
change to match an average creature of its new
form. These abilities and statistics return to
normal if the effect is later ended.</p>
      <p>Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune
to baleful polymorph, and a creature with the
shapechanger subtype (such as a lycanthrope or
a doppelganger) can revert to its natural form as
a standard action (which ends the spell’s effect).</p>

   <description>
      <p>
         <span>A
<i>binding </i>spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature. The target
gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least one-half your
caster level.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant
who casts <i>suggestion</i>, your caster level for this casting of <i>binding </i>increases
by 1. For each assistant who casts <i>dominate animal, dominate person, </i>or <i>dominate
monster, </i>your caster level for this casting of <i>binding </i>increases by
a number equal to one-third of that assistant’s level, provided that the
spell’s target is appropriate for a <i>binding </i>spell. Since the assistants’
spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the <i>binding
</i>spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants’ spells
are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial
Will saving throw and how long the <i>binding </i>lasts. All <i>binding </i>spells
are dismissible.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Regardless
of the version of <i>binding </i>you cast, you can specify triggering conditions
that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers
can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be
reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based
on a creature’s name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on
observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or
hit points don’t qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions
cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming
a saving throw is allowed) by 2.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
you are casting any of the first three versions of <i>binding </i>(those with
limited durations), you may cast additional <i>binding </i>spells to prolong
the effect, since the durations overlap. If you do so, the target gets a saving
throw at the end of the first spell’s duration, even if your caster level was
high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature succeeds on
this save, all the <i>binding </i>spells it has received are broken.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
<i>binding </i>spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions
when you cast the spell.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Chaining:
</span>
         </i>
         <span>The
subject is confined by restraints that generate an <i>antipathy </i>spell
affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is
one year per caster level. The subject of this form of <i>binding </i>is
confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Slumber:
</span>
         </i>
         <span>This
version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per
caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while <i>slumbering</i>,
nor does it age. This form of <i>binding </i>is more difficult to cast than <i>chaining</i>,
making it slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell’s save DC by 1.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Bound
Slumber: </span>
         </i>
         <span>This
combination of <i>chaining </i>and <i>slumber </i>lasts for as long as one
month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Hedged
Prison: </span>
         </i>
         <span>The
subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from
which it cannot wander by any means. The effect is permanent. Reduce the save
DC by 3.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Metamorphosis:
</span>
         </i>
         <span>The subject
assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar
or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature
remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the
container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The <i>binding </i>is
permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while <i>metamorphosed</i>,
nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Minimus
Containment: </span>
         </i>
         <span>The
subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem,
jar, or similar object. The <i>binding </i>is permanent. The subject does not
need to breathe, eat, or drink while <i>contained</i>, nor does it age. Reduce
the save DC by 4.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
can’t dispel a <i>binding </i>spell with <i>dispel magic </i>or a similar effect,
though an <i>antimagic field </i>or <i>Mage’s disjunction </i>affects it
normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane
due to <i>dismissal, banishment, </i>or a similar effect.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Components:
</span>
         </i>
         <span>The
components for a <i>binding </i>spell vary according to the version of the
spell, but they always include a continuous chanting utterance read from the
scroll or spellbook page containing the spell, somatic gestures, and materials
appropriate to the form of <i>binding </i>used. These components can include
such items as miniature chains of special metals, soporific herbs of the rarest
sort (for <i>slumber </i>bindings), a bell jar of the finest crystal, and the
like.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>In
addition to the specially made props suited to the specific type of <i>binding </i>(cost
500 gp), the spell requires opals worth at least 500 gp for each HD of the
target and a vellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be
captured.</span>

becomes good, which means it can bypass the damage reduction of certain

         <span>Physical
attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn’t
help opponents, since you’re ethereal and not merely invisible. If the attack
is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for
concealment).</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%.
(For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no
miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you
sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Any
individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you’re <i>blinking
</i>unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own
spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case
they typically do not affect the Material Plane.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>While
<i>blinking</i>, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage
from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). You strike as an invisible
creature (with a +2 bonus on attack rolls), denying your target any Dexterity

         <span>While
<i>blinking</i>, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For
each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you
become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space
and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled. You can move at only
three-quarters speed (because movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed,
and you spend about half your time there and half your time material.)</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Since
you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even
attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the
same way you interact with material ones.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>An
ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any
direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through
solid objects, including living creatures.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>An
ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks
gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to
60 feet.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Force
effects and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the
Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal
creature can’t attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal
affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have
attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane. Treat other ethereal
creatures and objects as material.</span>

orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth

obvious one. Once you have selected the locale, the sensor doesn’t move, but
you can rotate it in all directions to view the area as desired. Unlike other
scrying spells, this spell does not allow magically or supernaturally enhanced
senses to work through it. If the chosen locale is magically dark, you see
nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you can see in a 10- foot radius

      <p>
         <span>This
spell makes an inert duplicate of a creature. If the original individual has
been slain, its soul immediately transfers to the clone, creating a replacement
(provided that the soul is free and willing to return). The original’s physical
remains, should they still exist, become inert and cannot thereafter be
restored to life. If the original creature has reached the end of its natural
life span (that is, it has died of natural causes), any cloning attempt fails.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>To
create the duplicate, you must have a piece of flesh (not hair, nails, scales,
or the like) with a volume of at least 1 cubic inch that was taken from the
original creature’s living body. The piece of flesh need not be fresh, but it
must be kept from rotting. Once the spell is cast, the duplicate must be grown
in a laboratory for 2d4 months.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>When
the clone is completed, the original’s soul enters it immediately, if that
creature is already dead. The clone is physically identical with the original
and possesses the same personality and memories as the original. In other
respects, treat the clone as if it were the original character raised from the
dead, including the loss of one level or 2 points of Constitution (if the
original was a 1st-level character). If this Constitution adjustment would give
the clone a Constitution score of 0, the spell fails. If the original creature
has lost levels since the flesh sample was taken and died at a lower level than
the clone would otherwise be, the clone is one level below the level at which
the original died.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
spell duplicates only the original’s body and mind, not its equipment.</span>

duplicate can be grown while the original still lives, or when the original
soul is unavailable, but the resulting body is merely a soulless bit of inert

      <p>
         <span>This
spell generates a bank of fog, similar to a <i>fog cloud, </i>except that its
vapors are yellowish green and poisonous. These vapors automatically kill any
living creature with 3 or fewer HD (no save). A living creature with 4 to 6 HD
is slain unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save (in which case it takes 1d4
points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud).</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>A
living creature with 6 or more HD takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on
your turn each round while in the cloud (a successful Fortitude save halves
this damage). Holding one’s breath doesn’t help, but creatures immune to poison
are unaffected by the spell.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Unlike
a <i>fog cloud</i>, the <i>cloudkill </i>moves away from you at 10 feet per
round, rolling along the surface of the ground.</span>

         <span>Because
the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land,

Affected plant creatures can understand you, and they perceive your words and

obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that
something very dangerous is worth doing.</span>

subject is intelligent, it perceives your words and actions in the most
favorable way (treat its attitude as friendly). It will not attack you while
the spell lasts. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an
opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do.

a simple yes or no. (A cleric of no particular deity contacts a philosophically

given are correct within the limits of the entity’s knowledge. “Unclear” is a
legitimate answer, because powerful beings of the Outer Planes are not
necessarily omniscient. In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or
contrary to the deity’s interests, a short phrase (five words or less) may be

         <span>You
send your mind to another plane of existence (an Elemental Plane or some plane
farther removed) in order to receive advice and information from powers there.
(See the accompanying table for possible consequences and results of the
attempt.) The powers reply in a language you understand, but they resent such
contact and give only brief answers to your questions. (All questions are

one-word answer.)</span>

with minds far removed from your home plane increases the probability that you

the effect strikes as soon as the first question is asked, and no answer is

         <span>You
can place another spell upon your person so that it comes into effect under
some condition you dictate when casting <i>contingency</i>. The <i>contingency </i>spell
and the companion spell are cast at the same time. The 10-minute casting time
is the minimum total for both castings; if the companion spell has a casting
time longer than 10 minutes, use that instead.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
spell to be brought into effect by the <i>contingency </i>must be one that
affects your person and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your
caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level).</span>

      <p>
         <span>The
conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they
can be general. In all cases, the <i>contingency </i>immediately brings into
effect the companion spell, the latter being “cast” instantaneously when the
prescribed circumstances occur. If complicated or convoluted conditions are
prescribed, the whole spell combination (<i>contingency </i>and the companion
magic) may fail when called on. The companion spell occurs based solely on the
stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to.</span>

      <p>
         <span>You
can use only one <i>contingency </i>spell at a time; if a second is cast, the

         <i>
            <span>Lower
Water: </span>
         </i>
         <span>This
causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per
caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water is lowered within a
squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level x 10 feet long. In
extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell
creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them
at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration
of the spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures,
this spell acts as a <i>slow </i>spell (Will negates). The spell has no effect
on other creatures.</span>

         <i>
            <span>Raise
Water: </span>
         </i>
         <span>This
causes water or similar liquid to rise in height, just as the <i>lower water </i>version
causes it to lower. Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump
that the spell creates. If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks,
a beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill over onto dry land.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>With
either version, you may reduce one horizontal dimension by half and double the
other horizontal dimension.</span>

alter wind force in the area surrounding you. You can make the wind blow in a
certain direction or manner, increase its strength, or decrease its strength.
The new wind direction and strength persist until the spell ends or until you
choose to alter your handiwork, which requires concentration. You may create an
“eye” of calm air up to 80 feet in diameter at the center of the area if you so
desire, and you may choose to limit the area to any cylindrical area less than
your full limit.</span>

         <span>You
can detect a particular kind of animal or plant in a cone emanating out from
you in whatever direction you face. You must think of a kind of animal or plant
when using the spell, but you can change the animal or plant kind each round.
The amount of information revealed depends on how long you search a particular
area or focus on a specific kind of animal or plant.</span>

      <p>
         <i>
            <span>3rd
Round: </span>
         </i>
         <span>The
condition (see below) and location of each individual present. If an animal or
plant is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its
exact location.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Conditions:
</span>
         </i>
         <span>For
purposes of this spell, the categories of condition are as follows:</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Normal:
Has at least 90% of full normal hit points, free of disease.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Fair:
30% to 90% of full normal hit points remaining.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Poor:
Less than 30% of full normal hit points remaining, afflicted with a disease, or
suffering from a debilitating injury.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Weak:
0 or fewer hit points remaining, afflicted with a disease in the terminal
stage, or crippled.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
a creature falls into more than one category, the spell indicates the weaker of
the two.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Each
round you can turn to detect a kind of animal or plant in a new area. The spell
can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin
sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.</span>

Power: </span>
         </i>
         <span>An
evil aura’s power depends on the type of evil creature or object that you’re
detecting and its HD, caster level, or (in the case of a cleric) class level;
see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one strength
category, the spell indicates the stronger of the two.</span>

visualizing the area or by stating direction. After using this spell, you can’t
take any other actions until your next turn. You can bring along objects as
long as their weight doesn’t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one
additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to
its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature
counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures,
and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one

         <span>A
<i>discern location </i>spell is among the most powerful means of locating
creatures or objects. Nothing short of a <i>mind blank </i>spell or the direct
intervention of a deity keeps you from learning the exact location of a single
individual or object. <i>Discern location </i>circumvents normal means of
protection from scrying or location. The spell reveals the name of the creature
or object’s location (place, name, business name, building name, or the like),
community, county (or similar political division), country, continent, and the
plane of existence where the target lies.</span>

ranged touch attack to hit. Any creature struck by the ray takes 2d6 points of

used against an object, the ray simply disintegrates as much as one 10- foot

         <span>You
can use <i>dispel magic </i>to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a
creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item,
to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter
another spellcaster’s spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had
expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can’t be defeated by <i>dispel
magic</i>. <i>Dispel magic </i>can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects
just as it does spells.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Note:
</span>
         </i>
         <span>The
effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can’t be dispelled, because
the magical effect is already over before the <i>dispel magic </i>can take
effect. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
choose to use <i>dispel magic </i>in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an
area dispel, or a counterspell:</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Targeted
Dispel: </span>
         </i>
         <span>One
object, creature, or spell is the target of the <i>dispel magic </i>spell. You
make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell
or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature.
The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell’s caster level. If you succeed
on a particular check, that spell is dispelled; if you fail, that spell remains
in effect.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such
as a monster summoned by <i>monster summoning</i>), you make a dispel check to
end the spell that conjured the object or creature.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the
item’s caster level. If you succeed, all the item’s magical properties are
suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A
suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An
interdimensional interface (such as a <i>bag of holding</i>) is temporarily
closed. A magic item’s physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic
sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are
unaffected by mortal magic such as this.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast
yourself.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Area
Dispel: </span>
         </i>
         <span>When
<i>dispel magic </i>is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a
20-foot radius.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>For
each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you
make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that
check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until
you dispel one spell (which discharges the <i>dispel magic </i>spell so far as
that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature’s
magic items are not affected.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>For
each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make
dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area
dispel.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>For
each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of
the <i>dispel magic </i>spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>For
each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the <i>dispel magic </i>spell,
you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping
area.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster
summoned by <i>monster summoning</i>) is in the area, you can make a dispel
check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it
whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the
creature or object.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you
have cast.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Counterspell:
</span>

         <span>When <i>dispel
magic </i>is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a
counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, <i>dispel magic </i>may not
work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster’s spell.</span>

         <span>Similar
to <i>augury </i>but more powerful, a <i>divination </i>spell can provide you
with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific
goal, event, or activity that is to occur within one week. The advice can be as
simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen.
If your party doesn’t act on the information, the conditions may change so that
the information is no longer useful. The base chance for a correct <i>divination
</i>is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%. If the dice roll fails,
you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is
at work.</span>

beyond its own comprehension. You need not concentrate exclusively on
controlling the creature unless you are trying to direct it to do something it
normally couldn’t do. Changing your instructions or giving a <i>dominated </i>creature
a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.</span>

         <span>You
can control the actions of any humanoid creature through a telepathic link that
you establish with the subject’s mind.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject
to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common
language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as “Come here,”
“Go there,” “Fight,” and “Stand still.” You know what the subject is
experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it
communicate with you telepathically.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Once
you have given a <i>dominated </i>creature a command, it continues to attempt
to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those
necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth).
Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15
(rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject’s behavior is being
influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description).</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Changing
your instructions or giving a <i>dominated </i>creature a new command is the
equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>By
concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full
sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can’t
communicate with you. You can’t actually see through the subject’s eyes, so
it’s not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of
what’s going on.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Subjects
resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature
receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders
are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be
exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane.
You need not see the subject to control it.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
you don’t spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject
receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Protection
from evil </span>
         </i>
         <span>or
a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic
link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect neither prevents the
establishment of domination nor dispels it.</span>

identify him or her by some title that leaves no doubt as to identity. The
messenger then enters a trance, appears in the intended recipient’s dream, and
delivers the message. The message can be of any length, and the recipient
remembers it perfectly upon waking. The communication is one-way. The recipient
cannot ask questions or offer information, nor can the messenger gain any

up (ending the spell) or remain in the trance. The messenger can remain in the

Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to

collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of
stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it
halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a
collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half

open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming
muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of
the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area
must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end
of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained
water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.</span>

         <span>This
spell causes instant growth of a humanoid creature, doubling its height and
multiplying its weight by 8. This increase changes the creature’s size category
to the next larger one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to Strength, a −2 size
penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum of 1), and a −1 penalty on attack rolls and
AC due to its increased size.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>A
humanoid creature whose size increases to Large has a space of 10 feet and a
natural reach of 10 feet. This spell does not change the target’s speed.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the
maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased
Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is
constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it— the spell cannot be
used to crush a creature by increasing its size.</span>

      <p>
         <span>All
equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly enlarged by the spell.
Melee and projectile weapons affected by this spell deal more damage. Other
magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any <i>enlarged </i>item
that leaves an <i>enlarged </i>creature’s possession (including a projectile or
thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown
weapons deal their normal damage, and projectiles deal damage based on the size
of the weapon that fired them. Magical properties of <i>enlarged </i>items are
not increased by this spell.</span>

         <span>If
you have the attention of a group of creatures, you can use this spell to hold
them spellbound. To cast the spell, you must speak or sing without interruption
for 1 full round. Thereafter, those affected give you their undivided
attention, ignoring their surroundings. They are considered to have an attitude
of friendly while under the effect of the spell. Any potentially affected
creature of a race or religion unfriendly to yours gets a +4 bonus on the
saving throw.</span>

creature with 4 or more HD or with a Wisdom score of 16 or higher remains aware

if it witnesses actions that it opposes.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
effect lasts as long as you speak or sing, to a maximum of 1 hour. Those <i>enthralled
</i>by your words take no action while you speak or sing and for 1d3 rounds
thereafter while they discuss the topic or performance. Those entering the area
during the performance must also successfully save or become <i>enthralled. </i>The
speech ends (but the 1d3-round delay still applies) if you lose concentration
or do anything other than speak or sing.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
those not <i>enthralled </i>have unfriendly or hostile attitudes toward you,
they can collectively make a Charisma check to try to end the spell by jeering
and heckling. For this check, use the Charisma bonus of the creature with the
highest Charisma in the group; others may make Charisma checks to assist. The
heckling ends the spell if this check result beats your Charisma check result.
Only one such challenge is allowed per use of the spell.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
any member of the audience is attacked or subjected to some other overtly
hostile act, the spell ends and the previously <i>enthralled </i>members become
immediately unfriendly toward you. Each creature with 4 or more HD or with a
Wisdom score of 16 or higher becomes hostile.</span>

and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to every
creature within the area. Unattended objects also take this damage. The
explosion creates almost no pressure.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the <i>fireball
</i>is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and,
unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the
prescribed range, blossoms into the <i>fireball </i>at that point. (An early
impact results in an early detonation.) If you attempt to send the bead through
a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must “hit” the opening
with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates
prematurely.</span>

and descend at double speed, and its maneuverability is good. Using a <i>fly </i>spell

telepathically communicating (via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished

         <span>Casting
a <i>gate </i>spell has two effects. First, it creates an interdimensional
connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing
travel between those two planes in either direction.</span>
      </p>

         <span>The
<i>gate </i>itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter
(caster’s choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into
existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window
looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or
anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>A
<i>gate </i>has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the <i>gate </i>from
the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from

a mode of planar travel, a <i>gate </i>spell functions much like a <i>plane
shift </i>spell, except that the <i>gate </i>opens precisely at the point you
desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm
can prevent a <i>gate </i>from opening in their presence or personal demesnes
if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you—anyone who chooses to
step through the portal is transported. A <i>gate </i>cannot be opened to
another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.</span>

         <span>You
may hold the <i>gate </i>open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per
caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar
connection is severed.</span>

      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Calling
Creatures: </span>
         </i>
         <span>The
second effect of the <i>gate </i>spell is to call an extraplanar creature to
your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as
you cast the spell, you cause the <i>gate </i>to open in the immediate vicinity
of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling.
Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the <i>gate, </i>although
they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a <i>gate
</i>that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This
use of the spell has an XP cost (see below).</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual you may
call either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures. You can call
and control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed your
caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do
not exceed twice your caster level. A single creature with more HD than twice
your caster level can’t be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be
controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the
calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to
its home plane at any time.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>A
controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you. Such
services fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service.
Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be
accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you
need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature’s help. The
creature departs at the end of the spell.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called
creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The
service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or
reward; see the <i>lesser planar ally </i>spell for appropriate rewards. (Some
creatures may want their payment in “livestock” rather than in coin, which
could involve complications.) Immediately upon completion of the service, the
being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over
the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to
return to its own plane.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Failure
to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service
by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the
creature or its kin may attack you.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Note:
</span>
         </i>
         <span>When you
use a calling spell such as <i>gate </i>to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil,
fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type.</span>

<i>lesser geas </i>places a magical command on a creature to carry out some
service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by
you. The creature must have 7 or fewer Hit Dice and be able to understand you.
While a <i>geas </i>cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts
that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of
activity.</span>

         <span>If
the subject is prevented from obeying the <i>lesser geas </i>for 24 hours, it
takes a −2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another −2 penalty
accumulates, up to a total of −8. No ability score can be reduced to less than
1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the

      <p>
         <span>This
powerful inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open the warded area or
object. A <i>glyph of warding </i>can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal,
trap a chest or box, and so on.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
set the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature entering the warded
area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set
when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores. Alternatively or in
addition to a password trigger, <i>glyphs </i>can be set according to physical
characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind. <i>Glyphs
</i>can also be set with respect to good, evil, law, or chaos, or to pass those
of your religion. They cannot be set according to class, Hit Dice, or level. <i>Glyphs
</i>respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who
travel past them ethereally. Multiple <i>glyphs </i>cannot be cast on the same
area. However, if a cabinet has three drawers, each can be separately warded.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>When
casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the
warding sigil. A <i>glyph </i>can be placed to conform to any shape up to the
limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is completed, the <i>glyph
</i>and tracery become nearly invisible.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Glyphs
</span>
         </i>
         <span>cannot be
affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they
can be dispelled. <i>Mislead</i>, <i>polymorph</i>, and <i>nondetection </i>(and
similar magical effects) can fool a <i>glyph</i>, though nonmagical disguises
and the like can’t. <i>Read magic </i>allows you to identify a <i>glyph of
warding </i>with a DC 13 Spellcraft check. Identifying the <i>glyph </i>does
not discharge it and allows you to know the basic nature of the <i>glyph </i>(version,
type of damage caused, what spell is stored).</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Note:
</span>
         </i>
         <span>Magic
traps such as <i>glyph of warding </i>are hard to detect and disable. A rogue
(only) can use the Search skill to find the <i>glyph </i>and Disable Device to
thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 28 for <i>glyph of
warding</i>.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Depending
on the version selected, a <i>glyph </i>either blasts the intruder or activates
a spell.</span>

      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Blast
Glyph: </span>
         </i>
         <span>A <i>blast
glyph </i>deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to the
intruder and to all within 5 feet of him or her. This damage is acid, cold,
fire, electricity, or sonic (caster’s choice, made at time of casting). Each
creature affected can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage. Spell
resistance applies against this effect.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Spell
Glyph: </span>
         </i>
         <span>You
can store any harmful spell of 3rd level or lower that you know. All
level-dependent features of the spell are based on your caster level at the
time of casting the <i>glyph. </i>If the spell has a target, it targets the
intruder. If the spell has an area or an amorphous effect the area or effect is
centered on the intruder. If the spell summons creatures, they appear as close
as possible to the intruder and attack. Saving throws and spell resistance
operate as normal, except that the DC is based on the level of the spell stored
in the <i>glyph</i>.</span>

      <p>
         <span>A
<i>grease </i>spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery grease. Any
creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save
or fall. This save is repeated on your turn each round that the creature
remains within the area. A creature can walk within or through the area of
grease at half normal speed with a DC 10 Balance check. Failure means it can’t
move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5
or more means it falls (see the Balance skill for details).</span>

the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A
saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up

         <span>This
powerful spell is primarily used to defend your stronghold. The ward protects
200 square feet per caster level. The warded area can be as much as 20 feet
high, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by
dividing the area among them; you must be somewhere within the area to be
warded to cast the spell. The spell creates the following magical effects
within the warded area.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Fog:
</span>
         </i>
         <span>Fog fills
all corridors, obscuring all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A
creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance).
Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the
attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Saving Throw: None. Spell
Resistance: No.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Arcane
Locks: </span>
         </i>
         <span>All
doors in the warded area are <i>arcane locked. </i>Saving Throw: None. Spell
Resistance: No.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Webs:
</span>
         </i>
         <span>Webs fill
all stairs from top to bottom. These strands are identical with those created
by the <i>web </i>spell, except that they regrow in 10 minutes if they are
burned or torn away while the <i>guards and wards </i>spell lasts. Saving
Throw: Reflex negates; see text for <i>web</i>. Spell Resistance: No.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Confusion:
</span>
         </i>
         <span>Where
there are choices in direction—such as a corridor intersection or side
passage—a minor <i>confusion-</i>type effect functions so as to make it 50%
probable that intruders believe they are going in the opposite direction from
the one they actually chose. This is an enchantment, mind-affecting effect.
Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: Yes.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Lost
Doors: </span>
         </i>
         <span>One
door per caster level is covered by a <i>silent image </i>to appear as if it
were a plain wall. Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with). Spell
Resistance: No.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>In
addition, you can place your choice of one of the following five magical
effects.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>1.
<i>Dancing lights </i>in four corridors. You can designate a simple program
that causes the lights to repeat as long as the <i>guards and wards </i>spell
lasts. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>2.
A <i>magic mouth </i>in two places. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>3.
A <i>stinking cloud </i>in two places. The vapors appear in the places you
designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while the <i>guards
and wards </i>spell lasts. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates; see text for <i>stinking
cloud. </i>Spell Resistance: No.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>4.
A <i>gust of wind </i>in one corridor or room. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates.
Spell Resistance: Yes.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>5.
A <i>suggestion </i>in one place. You select an area of up to 5 feet square,
and any creature who enters or passes through the area receives the <i>suggestion
</i>mentally. Saving Throw: Will negates. Spell Resistance: Yes.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
whole warded area radiates strong magic of the abjuration school. A <i>dispel
magic </i>cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect. A
successful <i>Mage’s disjunction </i>destroys the entire <i>guards and wards </i>effect.</span>

         <span>The
transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal. This extra speed
has several effects.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>When
making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with
any weapon he is holding. The attack is made using the creature’s full base
attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is
not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a weapon of
speed, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can’t use it to cast
a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.)</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>A
<i>hasted </i>creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to
AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to
Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>All
of the <i>hasted </i>creature’s modes of movement (including land movement,
burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the
subject’s normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an
enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature’s jumping distance as normal for
increased speed.</span>

      <p>
         <span>Multiple
<i>haste </i>effects don’t stack. <i>Haste </i>dispels and counters <i>slow.</i>

         <i>
            <span>Heat
metal </span>
         </i>
         <span>makes
metal extremely warm. Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw.
Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell. An item in a
creature’s possession uses the creature’s saving throw bonus unless its own is
higher.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>A
creature takes fire damage if its equipment is heated. It takes full damage if
its armor is affected or if it is holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal
weighing one-fifth of its weight. The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or
2 points; see the table) if it’s not wearing metal armor and the metal that
it’s carrying weighs less than one-fifth of its weight.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>On
the first round of the spell, the metal becomes warm and uncomfortable to touch
but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on the last round of the
spell’s duration. During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, intense
heat causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal
is searing hot, causing more damage, as shown on the table below.</span>

         <span>Once
the hand locates the subject, it beckons the creature to follow it. If the
subject does so, the hand points in your direction, indicating the most direct
feasible route. The hand hovers 10 feet in front of the subject, moving before
it at a speed of as much as 240 feet per round. Once the hand leads the subject
back to you, it disappears.</span>

travel more than 5 miles from the spot it appeared when you cast the spell.</span>

each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance
bonus on saves. Unlike <i>protection from evil</i>, this benefit applies
against all attacks, not just against attacks by evil creatures.</span>

each warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against evil spells and spells
cast by evil creatures.</span>

      <p>
         <span>Third,
the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as <i>protection
from evil </i>does.</span>

      <p>
         <span>Finally,
if an evil creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the
offending attacker is blinded (Fortitude save negates, as <i>blindness/deafness</i>,
but against <i>holy aura’s </i>save DC).</span>

write instructions or other information on parchment, paper, or any suitable
writing material. The <i>illusory script </i>appears to be some form of foreign
or magical writing. Only the person (or people) designated by you at the time of

character, although an illusionist recognizes it as <i>illusory script.</i>

      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Any
unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory
effect and must make a saving throw. A successful saving throw means the
creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure means
the creature is subject to a suggestion implanted in the script by you at the
time the illusory script spell was cast. The suggestion lasts only 30 minutes.
Typical suggestions include “Close the book and leave,” “Forget the existence
of the book,” and so forth. If successfully dispelled by <i>dispel magic, </i>the
<i>illusory script </i>and its secret message disappear. The hidden message can
be read by a combination of the <i>true seeing </i>spell with the <i>read magic

with white-hot embers. The smoke obscures all sight as a <i>fog cloud </i>does.
In addition, the white-hot embers within the cloud deal 4d6 points of fire
damage to everything within the cloud on your turn each round. All targets can
make Reflex saves each round to take half damage.</span>

origin, which is 10 feet farther away from where you were when you cast the spell.
By concentrating, you can make the cloud (actually its point of origin) move as
much as 60 feet each round. Any portion of the cloud that would extend beyond
your maximum range dissipates harmlessly, reducing the remainder’s spread
thereafter.</span>

         <span>The
creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from sight, even from
darkvision. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too.
If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the
subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do
so.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Items
dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up
disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light,
however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so
(thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an
item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it
becomes visible.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Of
course, the subject is not magically <i>silenced, </i>and certain other
conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle).
The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell,
an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a
foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character’s perceptions.)
Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm
indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk,
eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding
a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a
portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks
directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear.
Spells such as <i>bless </i>that specifically affect allies but not foes are
not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.</span>

serve to hold closures shut). If used to open a <i>arcane locked </i>door, the
spell does not remove the <i>arcane lock </i>but simply suspends its
functioning for 10 minutes. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself
or become stuck again on its own. <i>Knock </i>does not raise barred gates or
similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines,
and the like. The effect is limited by the area. Each spell can undo as many as
two means of preventing egress. </span>

to your mind legends about an important person, place, or thing. If the person
or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time
is only 1d4x10 minutes. If you have only detailed information on the person,
place, or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less
complete and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you
find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better <i>legend lore </i>result
next time). If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the
resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more
detailed information, thus allowing a better <i>legend lore </i>result next
time).</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>During
the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating,
sleeping, and so forth. When completed, the divination brings legends (if any)
about the person, place, or things to your mind. These may be legends that are
still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has
never been generally known. If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary
importance, you gain no information. As a rule of thumb, characters who are
11th level and higher are “legendary,” as are the sorts of creatures they
contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform
their key deeds.</span>

         <span>You
hide a chest on the Ethereal Plane for as long as sixty days and can retrieve
it at will. The chest can contain up to 1 cubic foot of material per caster
level (regardless of the chest’s actual size, which is about 3 feet by 2 feet
by 2 feet). If any living creatures are in the chest, there is a 75% chance
that the spell simply fails. Once the chest is hidden, you can retrieve it by
concentrating (a standard action), and it appears next to you.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive, constructed for you by
master crafters. The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it
is constructed, you must make a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect
in every detail), so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect
copy. (The replica costs 50 gp.) You can have but one pair of these chests at
any given time—even a <i>wish </i>spell does not allow more. The chests are
nonmagical and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal
chest can be.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>To
hide the chest, you cast the spell while touching both the chest and the
replica. The chest vanishes into the Ethereal Plane. You need the replica to
recall the chest. After sixty days, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day
that the chest is irretrievably lost. If the miniature of the chest is lost or
destroyed, there is no way, not even with a <i>wish </i>spell, that the large
chest can be summoned back, although an extraplanar expedition might be mounted
to find it.</span>

things in the chest eat, sleep, and age normally, and they die if they run out

conjure a sturdy cottage or lodge made of material that is common in the area

      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The

adversely affects it and its occupants. The dwelling does, however, provide
considerable security otherwise—it is as strong as a normal stone building,
regardless of its material composition. The dwelling resists flames and fire as

siege engines or giants).</span>

protection against the elements, such as rain, dust, and sandstorms. The hut
withstands any wind of less than hurricane force, but a hurricane (75+ mph wind

cannot be seen from outside the hut (they have total concealment).</span>

      <p>
         <span>All
creatures within the area gain the effects of a <i>protection from evil </i>spell,
and no nongood summoned creatures can enter the area either. You must overcome
a creature’s spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third
function of <i>protection from evil</i>), but the deflection and resistance
bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies’
spell resistance.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>This
spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A <i>magic
circle against evil </i>can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused
inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the <i>lesser
planar binding, planar binding, </i>and <i>greater planar binding </i>spells)
for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell
that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the <i>magic circle</i>. The
creature cannot cross the circle’s boundaries. If a creature too large to fit
into the spell’s area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal <i>protection
from evil </i>spell for that creature only.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>A
<i>magic circle </i>leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of
powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect
immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle,
directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has
spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its
spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature
capable of any form of dimensional travel (<i>astral projection, blink,
dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, </i>and
similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means. You can
prevent the creature’s extradimensional escape by casting a <i>dimensional
anchor </i>spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts.
If you are successful, the <i>anchor </i>effect lasts as long as the <i>magic
circle </i>does. The creature cannot reach across the <i>magic circle, </i>but
its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like)
can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks
except for the circle itself.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along
its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the <i>magic
circle </i>more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and
requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If
the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the
diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This
task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3
hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>A
successful diagram allows you to cast a <i>dimensional anchor </i>spell on the <i>magic
circle </i>during the round before casting any summoning spell. The <i>anchor </i>holds
any called creatures in the <i>magic circle </i>for 24 hours per caster level.
A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a <i>magic circle </i>prepared
with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If
the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the <i>lesser
planar binding </i>spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately
released if anything disturbs the diagram—even a straw laid across it. However,
the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly,
as noted above.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>This
spell is not cumulative with <i>protection from evil </i>and vice versa.</span>

   <description>
      <p>
         <span>By
casting <i>magic jar, </i>you place your soul in a gem or large crystal (known
as the <i>magic jar</i>), leaving your body lifeless. Then you can attempt to
take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the <i>magic jar. </i>You
may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and
attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to
your own body, leaving the receptacle empty.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>To
cast the spell, the <i>magic jar </i>must be within spell range and you must
know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it.
When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can
tell, dead. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>While
in the <i>magic jar, </i>you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet
per caster level (and on the same plane of existence). You do need line of
effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature
types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense
a difference of 4 or more Hit Dice between one creature and another and can
determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy.
(Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead
creatures have, or are, souls.)</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which
particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined
randomly.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Attempting
to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by <i>protection from
evil </i>or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature’s soul
into the <i>magic jar </i>unless the subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure
to take over the host leaves your life force in the <i>magic jar, </i>and the
target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to
possess its body again.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host’s life
force is imprisoned in the <i>magic jar. </i>You keep your Intelligence,
Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses,
alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body
with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous
two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can’t choose to activate the body’s
extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature’s spells and spell-like
abilities do not stay with the body.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>As
a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the <i>magic jar </i>if
within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when
you shift from the jar to your own body.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
the host body is slain, you return to the <i>magic jar, </i>if within range,
and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain
beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with
nowhere to go is treated as slain.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
the spell ends while you are in the <i>magic jar, </i>you return to your body
(or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you
are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your
current position), and the soul in the <i>magic jar </i>returns to its body (or
dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the
spell can be dispelled at either the <i>magic jar </i>or at the host’s
location.</span>

      <p>
         <span>This
spell imbues the chosen object or creature with an enchanted mouth that
suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time a specified event occurs.
The message, which must be twenty-five or fewer words long, can be in any
language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The
mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical
effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were
placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak.
Of course, <i>magic mouth </i>can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other
object or creature.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your
command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as
desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react
to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal
darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical <i>darkness </i>or <i>invisibility
</i>does. Silent movement or magical <i>silence </i>defeats audible triggers.
Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise
or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A
<i>magic mouth </i>cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class
except by external garb.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can
command a <i>magic mouth </i>to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away.
Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers
and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.</span>

draw an indelible mark on the subject and state some behavior on the part of
the subject that will activate the mark. When activated, the mark curses the

identical with the effect of <i>bestow curse</i>.</span>

banish the subject into an extradimensional labyrinth of force planes. Each

escaping or leaving the maze, the subject reappears where it had been when the <i>maze

appears in the nearest open space. Spells and abilities that move a creature
within a plane, such as <i>teleport </i>and <i>dimension door, </i>do not help
a creature escape a <i>maze </i>spell, although a <i>plane shift </i>spell
allows it to exit to whatever plane is designated in that spell. Minotaurs are

you to meld your body and possessions into a single block of stone. The stone
must be large enough to accommodate your body in all three dimensions. When the
casting is complete, you and not more than 100 pounds of nonliving gear merge
with the stone. If either condition is violated, the spell fails and is wasted.</span>
      </p>

         <span>While
in the stone, you remain in contact, however tenuous, with the face of the
stone through which you melded. You remain aware of the passage of time and can
cast spells on yourself while hiding in the stone. Nothing that goes on outside
the stone can be seen, but you can still hear what happens around you. Minor
physical damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction (to
the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals you 5d6
points of damage. The stone’s complete destruction expels you and slays you
instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Any
time before the duration expires, you can step out of the stone through the
surface that you entered. If the spell’s duration expires or the effect is
dispelled before you voluntarily exit the stone, you are violently expelled and
take 5d6 points of damage.</span>

         <span>The
following spells harm you if cast upon the stone that you are occupying: <i>Stone
to flesh </i>expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. <i>Stone shape </i>deals
you 3d6 points of damage but does not expel you. <i>Transmute rock to mud </i>expels
you and then slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save, in
which case you are merely expelled. Finally, <i>passwall </i>expels you without
damage.</span>

         <span>is
a very powerful and spectacular spell that is similar to <i>fireball </i>in
many aspects. When you cast it, four 2- foot-diameter spheres spring from your
outstretched hand and streak in straight lines to the spots you select. The
meteor spheres leave a fiery trail of sparks.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
you aim a sphere at a specific creature, you may make a ranged touch attack to strike
the target with the meteor. Any creature struck by one of these spheres takes
2d6 points of bludgeoning damage (no save) and receives no saving throw against
the sphere’s fire damage (see below). If a targeted sphere misses its target,
it simply explodes at the nearest corner of the target’s space. You may aim
more than one meteor at the same target.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Once
a sphere reaches its destination, it explodes in a 40-foot-radius spread,
dealing 6d6 points of fire damage to each creature in the area. If a creature
is within the area of more than one sphere, it must save separately against
each. (Fire resistance applies to each sphere’s damage individually.)</span>

         <span>See text</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
don’t so much cast a <i>miracle </i>as request one. You state what you would
like to have happen and request that your deity (or the power you pray to for
spells) intercede.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>A
<i>miracle </i>can do any of the following things.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>· </span>
         <span>Duplicate any cleric spell
of 8th level or lower (including spells to which you have access because of
your domains). </span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>· </span>
         <span>Duplicate any other spell
of 7th level or lower.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>· </span>
         <span>Undo the harmful effects
of certain spells, such as <i>feeblemind </i>or <i>insanity</i>.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>· </span>
         <span>Have any effect whose
power level is in line with the above effects.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
the <i>miracle </i>has any of the above effects, casting it has no experience
point cost.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Alternatively,
a cleric can make a very powerful request. Casting such a <i>miracle </i>costs
the cleric 5,000 XP because of the powerful divine energies involved. Examples
of especially powerful <i>miracles </i>of this sort could include the
following.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>· </span>
         <span>Swinging the tide of a
battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>· </span>
         <span>Moving you and your
allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to another through planar
barriers to a specific locale with no chance of error.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>· </span>
         <span>Protecting a city from an
earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>In
any event, a request that is out of line with the deity’s (or alignment’s)
nature is refused.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>A
duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the
save DCs are as for a 9th-level spell. When a <i>miracle </i>duplicates a spell
that has an XP cost, you must pay that cost. When a <i>miracle </i>spell
duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you
must provide that component.</span>

      <p>
         <span>Several
illusory duplicates of you pop into being, making it difficult for enemies to
know which target to attack. The figments stay near you and disappear when
struck.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Mirror
image </span>
         </i>
         <span>creates
1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total).
These figments separate from you and remain in a cluster, each within 5 feet of
at least one other figment or you. You can move into and through a <i>mirror
image. </i>When you and the <i>mirror image </i>separate, observers can’t use
vision or hearing to tell which one is you and which the image. The figments
may also move through each other. The figments mimic your actions, pretending
to cast spells when you cast a spell, drink potions when you drink a potion,
levitate when you levitate, and so on.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Enemies
attempting to attack you or cast spells at you must select from among
indistinguishable targets. Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected
target is real or a figment. Any successful attack against an image destroys
it. An image’s AC is 10 + your size modifier + your Dex modifier. Figments seem
to react normally to area spells (such as looking like they’re burned or dead
after being hit by a <i>fireball</i>).</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>While
moving, you can merge with and split off from figments so that enemies who have
learned which image is real are again confounded.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>An
attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled. If you are invisible or
an attacker shuts his or her eyes, the spell has no effect. (Being unable to
see carries the same penalties as being blinded.)</span>

         <span>By
means of this spell, you misdirect the information from divination spells that
reveal auras (<i>detect evil, detect magic, discern lies, </i>and the like). On
casting the spell, you choose another object within range. For the duration of
the spell, the subject of <i>misdirection </i>is detected as if it were the
other object. (Neither the subject nor the other object gets a saving throw
against this effect.) Detection spells provide information based on the second
object rather than on the actual target of the detection unless the caster of
the detection succeeds on a Will save. For instance, you could make yourself
detect as a tree if one were within range at casting: not evil, not lying, not
magical, neutral in alignment, and so forth. This spell does not affect other
types of divination magic (<i>augury, detect thoughts,
clairaudience/clairvoyance, </i>and the like).</span>

become invisible (as <i>improved invisibility</i>, a glamer), and at the same

are then free to go elsewhere while your double moves away. The double appears
within range but thereafter moves as you direct it (which requires
concentration beginning on the first round after the casting). You can make the
figment appear superimposed perfectly over your own body so that observers
don’t notice an image appearing and you turning invisible. You and the figment
can then move in different directions. The double moves at your speed and can
talk and gesture as if it were real, but it cannot attack or cast spells,
though it can pretend to do so.</span>

         <span>Casting
the spell takes 1 round. If the subject fails to save, you proceed with the
spell by spending as much as 5 minutes (a period of time equal to the amount of
memory time you want to modify) visualizing the memory you wish to modify in
the subject. If your concentration is disturbed before the visualization is complete,
or if the subject is ever beyond the spell’s range during this time, the spell
is lost.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>A
modified memory does not necessarily affect the subject’s actions, particularly
if it contradicts the creature’s natural inclinations. An illogical modified memory
is dismissed by the creature as a bad dream or a memory muddied by too much
wine. </span>

then guards the area where it was conjured (it does not move). The hound
immediately starts barking loudly if any Small or larger creature approaches within
30 feet of it. (Those within 30 feet of the hound when it is conjured may move
about in the area, but if they leave and return, they activate the barking.)
The hound sees invisible and ethereal creatures. It does not react to figments,

         <span>If
an intruder approaches to within 5 feet of the hound, the dog stops barking and

once per round. The dog also gets the bonuses appropriate to an invisible
creature.</span>

         <span>The
dog is considered ready to bite intruders, so it delivers its first bite on the

of damage reduction. The hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled.</span>

spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level, but once the hound begins barking, it
lasts only 1 round per caster level. If you are ever more than 100 feet distant

         <span>The
sword always strikes from your direction. It does not get a bonus for flanking
or help a combatant get one. If the sword goes beyond the spell range from you,
if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the sword returns
to you and hovers.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Each
round after the first, you can use a standard action to switch the sword to a
new target. If you do not, the sword continues to attack the previous round’s
target.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
sword cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <i>dispel magic</i>,
<i>disintegrate</i>, a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i>rod of
cancellation </i>affects it. The sword’s AC is 13 (10, +0 size bonus for Medium
object, +3 deflection bonus).</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first
time <i>Mordenkainen’s sword </i>strikes it. If the sword is successfully resisted, the
spell is dispelled. If not, the sword has its normal full effect on that
creature for the duration of the spell.</span>

shifting dunes, and so forth.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>However,
in no event can rock formations be collapsed or moved. The area to be affected
determines the casting time. For every 150-foot square (up to 10 feet deep),
casting takes 10 minutes. The maximum area, 750 feet by 750 feet, takes 4 hours
and 10 minutes to move.</span>

      <p>
         <span>This
spell does not violently break the surface of the ground. Instead, it creates
wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting with glacierlike fluidity
until the desired result is achieved. Trees, structures, rock formations, and
such are mostly unaffected except for changes in elevation and relative
topography.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
spell cannot be used for tunneling and is generally too slow to trap or bury

detoxify any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. A poisoned
creature suffers no additional effects from the poison, and any temporary

warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells such
as <i>clairaudience/clairvoyance, locate object, </i>and <i>detect </i>spells. <i>Nondetection

divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the
divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a
DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast <i>nondetection</i>. If
you cast <i>nondetection </i>on yourself or on an item currently in your

a frigid globe of cold energy that streaks from your fingertips to the location
you select, where it explodes in a 10-foot-radius burst, dealing 1d6 points of
cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to each creature in the area. An
elemental (water) creature instead takes 1d8 points of cold damage per caster
level (maximum 15d8).</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
the <i>freezing sphere </i>strikes a body of water or a liquid that is
principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid
to a depth of 6 inches over an area equal to 100 square feet (a 10- foot
square) per caster level (maximum 1,500 square feet). This ice lasts for 1
round per caster level. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen
water become trapped in the ice. Attempting to break free is a full-round
action. A trapped creature must make a DC 25 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape
Artist check to do so.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish.
Treat this as a touch spell for which you are holding the charge. You can hold
the charge for as long as 1 round per level, at the end of which time the <i>freezing
sphere </i>bursts centered on you (and you receive no saving throw to resist
its effect). Firing the globe in a later round is a standard action.</span>

      <p>
         <span>This
spell functions like <i>resilient sphere, </i>with the addition that the
creatures or objects inside the globe are nearly weightless. Anything contained
within an <i>telekinetic sphere </i>weighs only one-sixteenth of its normal
weight. You can telekinetically lift anything in the sphere that normally
weighs 5,000 pounds or less. The telekinetic control extends from you out to
medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) after the sphere has
succeeded in encapsulating its contents.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
can move objects or creatures in the sphere that weigh a total of 5,000 pounds
or less by concentrating on the sphere. You can begin moving a sphere in the
round after casting the spell. If you concentrate on doing so (a standard
action), you can move the sphere as much as 30 feet in a round. If you cease
concentrating, the sphere does not move in that round (if on a level surface)
or descends at its falling rate (if aloft) until it reaches a level surface, or
the spell’s duration expires, or you begin concentrating again. If you cease
concentrating (voluntarily or due to failing a Concentration check), you can
resume concentrating on your next turn or any later turn during the spell’s
duration.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
sphere falls at a rate of only 60 feet per round, which is not fast enough to
cause damage to the contents of the sphere.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
can move the sphere telekinetically even if you are in it.</span>

spell creates an ethereal passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but

enter the <i>phase door </i>and appear when you exit. If you desire, you can
take one other creature (Medium or smaller) through the door. This counts as
two uses of the door. The door does not allow light, sound, or spell effects
through it, nor can you see through it without using it. Thus, the spell can
provide an escape route, though certain creatures, such as phase spiders, can follow
with ease. A <i>gem of true seeing </i>or similar magic reveals the presence of

      <p>
         <span>By
casting this spell, you request your deity to send you an elemental or outsider
(of 6 HD or less) of the deity’s choice. If you serve no particular deity, the
spell is a general plea answered by a creature sharing your philosophical
alignment. If you know an individual creature’s name, you may request that individual
by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different
creature anyway).</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
may ask the creature to perform one task in exchange for a payment from you.
Tasks might range from the simple to the complex. You must be able to communicate
with the creature called in order to bargain for its services.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
creature called requires a payment for its services. This payment can take a
variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a
gift given directly to the creature, to some other action on your part that
matches the creature’s alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must be
made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes
at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it
arrives.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>A
task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD
of the creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the
creature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD. A long-term task, one requiring
up to one day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per HD.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>A
nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially
hazardous task might require a greater gift. Few if any creatures will accept a
task that seems suicidal (remember, a called creature actually dies when it is
killed, unlike a summoned creature). However, if the task is strongly aligned
with the creature’s ethos, it may halve or even waive the payment. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>At
the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for expires, the creature
returns to its home plane (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and
possible).</span>

         <span>Casting
this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a creature from another plane to a
specifically prepared trap, which must lie within the spell’s range. The called
creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return
for its freedom.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>To
create the trap, you must use a <i>magic circle </i>spell, focused inward. The
kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a
specific individual, you must use that individual’s proper name in casting the
spell.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
target creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds,
the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is
immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being
called). The creature can escape from the trap with by successfully pitting its
spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or
with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Cha
modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee
or attack you. A <i>dimensional anchor </i>cast on the creature prevents its
escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see <i>magic
circle against evil</i>) to make the trap more secure.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long
as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by
describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a
Charisma check opposed by the creature’s Charisma check. The check is assigned
a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the
creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and
the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can
be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or
until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible
demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you roll a 1 on the
Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the binding and can escape or
attack you.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Once
the requested service is completed, the creature need only so inform you to be
instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If
you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete though its
own actions the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster
level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free. Note that a
clever recipient can subvert some instructions.</span>

you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good,

      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Upon
changing, the subject regains lost hit points as if it had rested for a night
(though this healing does not restore temporary ability damage and provide
other benefits of resting; and changing back does not heal the subject
further). If slain, the subject reverts to its original form, though it remains
dead.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
subject gains the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the new form
but retains its own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. It also gains
all extraordinary special attacks possessed by the form but does not gain the
extraordinary special qualities possessed by the new form or any supernatural
or spell-like abilities.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Incorporeal
or gaseous creatures are immune to being <i>polymorphed</i>, and a creature
with the shapechanger subtype can revert to its natural form as a standard
action.</span>

         <span>This
spell functions like <i>polymorph, </i>except that it changes one object or
creature into another. The duration of the spell depends on how radical a
change is made from the original state to its enchanted state. The duration is
determined by using the following guidelines.</span>

         <span>Prestidigitations
are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice. Once cast, a <i>prestidigitation
</i>spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects
are minor and have severe limitations. A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1
pound of material. It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each
round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. It cannot
deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. <i>Prestidigitation </i>can
create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created
by a <i>prestidigitation </i>spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be
used as tools, weapons, or spell components. Finally, a <i>prestidigitation </i>lacks
the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object
(beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.</span>

can pass into and out of the <i>prismatic sphere </i>and remain near it without
harm. However, when you’re inside it, the sphere blocks any attempt to project
something through the sphere (including spells). Other creatures that attempt
to attack you or pass through suffer the effects of each color, one at a time.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Typically,
only the upper hemisphere of the globe will exist, since you are at the center
of the sphere, so the lower half is usually excluded by the floor surface you
are standing on.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
colors of the sphere have the same effects as the colors of a <i>prismatic
wall.</i>

         <i>
            <span>Prismatic
wall </span>
         </i>
         <span>creates
a vertical, opaque wall—a shimmering, multicolored plane of light that protects
you from all forms of attack. The wall flashes with seven colors, each of which
has a distinct power and purpose. The wall is immobile, and you can pass
through and remain near the wall without harm. However, any other creature with
less than 8 HD that is within 20 feet of the wall is blinded for 2d4 rounds by
the colors if it looks at the wall.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
wall’s maximum proportions are 4 feet wide per caster level and 2 feet high per
caster level. A <i>prismatic wall </i>spell cast to materialize in a space
occupied by a creature is disrupted, and the spell is wasted.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Each
color in the wall has a special effect. The accompanying table shows the seven
colors of the wall, the order in which they appear, their effects on creatures
trying to attack you or pass through the wall, and the magic needed to negate each
color.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
wall can be destroyed, color by color, in consecutive order, by various magical
effects; however, the first color must be brought down before the second can be
affected, and so on. A <i>rod of cancellation </i>or a m<i>age’s disjunction </i>spell
destroys a <i>prismatic wall</i>, but an <i>antimagic field </i>fails to
penetrate it. <i>Dispel magic </i>and <i>greater dispel magic </i>cannot dispel
the wall or anything beyond it. Spell resistance is effective against a <i>prismatic
wall</i>, but the caster level check must be repeated for each color present.</span>

         <i>
            <span>Prismatic

         <span>In
addition to providing illumination, the flames can be hurled or used to touch
enemies. You can strike an opponent with a melee touch attack, dealing fire
damage equal to 1d6 +1 point per caster level (maximum +5). Alternatively, you
can hurl the flames up to 120 feet as a thrown weapon. When doing so, you
attack with a ranged touch attack (with no range penalty) and deal the same
damage as with the melee attack. No sooner do you hurl the flames than a new
set appears in your hand. Each attack you make reduces the remaining duration
by 1 minute. If an attack reduces the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less,
the spell ends after the attack resolves.</span>

      <p>
         <span>This
spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and
from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a
distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major
effects.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>First,
the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on
saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil
creatures.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Second,
the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a <i>magic
jar </i>attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature
(including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects
that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as <i>dominate
person</i>). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the
protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the <i>protection
from evil </i>effect. If the <i>protection from evil </i>effect ends before the
effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller would then be able
to mentally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a
possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell
is cast. This second effect works regardless of alignment.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Third,
the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the
natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if
such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good summoned creatures are
immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures
ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the
barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to
overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.</span>

         <span>You
create a number of semitangible, visible magical orbs (called “eyes”) equal to
1d4 + your caster level. These eyes move out, scout around, and return as you
direct them when casting the spell. Each eye can see 120 feet (normal vision
only) in all directions.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>While
the individual eyes are quite fragile, they’re small and difficult to spot.
Each eye is a Fine construct, about the size of a small apple, that has 1 hit
point, AC 18 (+8 bonus for its size), flies at a speed of 30 feet with perfect
maneuverability, and has a +16 Hide modifier. It has a Spot modifier equal to
your caster level (maximum +15) and is subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and
any other factors that would affect your ability to receive visual information
about your surroundings. An eye traveling through darkness must find its way by
touch.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>When
you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them to follow in a
command of no more than twenty-five words. Any knowledge you possess is known
by the eyes as well.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>In
order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each replays
in your mind all it has seen during its existence. It takes an eye 1 round to
replay 1 hour of recorded images. After relaying its findings, an eye
disappears. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist.
However, your link with the eye is such that you won’t know if the eye was
destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other event.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they return to you. <i>Dispel
magic </i>can destroy eyes. Roll separately for each eye caught in an area
dispel. Of course, if an eye is sent into darkness, it could hit a wall or
similar obstacle and destroy itself.</span>

restore life to a deceased creature. You can raise a creature that has been
dead for no longer than one day per caster level. In addition, the subject’s
soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject’s soul is not willing

receives no saving throw.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Coming
back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell loses one level (or 1
Hit Die) when it is raised, just as if it had lost a level or a Hit Die to an
energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it loses 2 points of
Constitution instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can’t be
raised). This level/HD loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any
means. A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any
given spell upon being raised, in addition to losing spells for losing a level.
A spellcasting creature that doesn’t prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a
50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast
a spell, in addition to losing spell slots for losing a level.</span>

raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its current Hit Dice. Any
ability scores damaged to 0 are raised to 1. Normal poison and normal disease
are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and
curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal
damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole.
Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to
life. None of the dead creature’s equipment or possessions are affected in any
way by this spell.</span>

spell causes instant diminution of a humanoid creature, halving its height,
length, and width and dividing its weight by 8. This decrease changes the
creature’s size category to the next smaller one. The target gains a +2 size
bonus to Dexterity, a −2 size penalty to Strength (to a minimum of 1), and a +1
bonus on attack rolls and AC due to its reduced size.</span>

create powerful magic in some specially prepared object. This object contains
the power to instantly transport its possessor across any distance within the

willingly to a creature and at the same time inform it of a command word to be
spoken when the item is used. To make use of the item, the subject speaks the
command word at the same time that it rends or breaks the item (a standard
action). When this is done, the individual and all objects it is wearing and
carrying (to a maximum of the character’s heavy load) are instantly transported
to your abode. No other creatures are affected (aside from a familiar that is
touching the subject).</span>

         <span>With
this spell, you bring back a dead creature in another body, provided that its
death occurred no more than one week before the casting of the spell and the
subject’s soul is free and willing to return. If the subject’s soul is not
willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to
return receives no saving throw.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Since
the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions
are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some
small portion of the creature’s body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but
the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature’s body at
the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult
body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process
takes 1 hour to complete.  When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>A
reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It
retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its
class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged.
Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body.
First eliminate the subject’s racial adjustments (since it is no longer of his
previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining
ability scores. The subject’s level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1. If the
subject was 1st level, its new Constitution score is reduced by 2. (If this
reduction would put its Con at 0 or lower, it can’t be reincarnated). This
level/HD loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>It’s
possible for the change in the subject’s ability scores to make it difficult
for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject
is well advised to become a multiclass character.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>For
a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the following
table. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type
should be created.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>A
creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect
can’t be returned to life by this spell.  Constructs, elementals, outsiders,
and undead creatures can’t be reincarnated. The spell cannot bring back a
creature who has died of old age.</span>

the creature’s hit points. The value of the energy resistance granted increases
to 20 points at 7th level and to a maximum of 30 points at 11th level. The

this spell is cast upon a piece of rope from 5 to 30 feet long, one end of the
rope rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground,
as if affixed at the upper end. The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an
extradimensional space that is outside the multiverse of extradimensional
spaces (“planes”). Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden, beyond
the reach of spells (including divinations), unless those spells work across
planes. The space holds as many as eight creatures (of any size). Creatures in
the space can pull the rope up into the space, making the rope “disappear.” In
that case, the rope counts as one of the eight creatures that can fit in the
space. The rope can support up to 16,000 pounds. A weight greater than that can
pull the rope free.</span>

cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects

the Material Plane, but it’s invisible, and even creatures that can see the
window can’t see through it. Anything inside the extradimensional space drops
out when the spell ends. The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time.

within a 3-foot radius a 3-foot-radius volume of the metal is rusted and
destroyed. Magic items made of metal are immune to this spell.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
may employ <i>rusting grasp </i>in combat with a successful melee touch attack.
<i>Rusting grasp </i>used in this way instantaneously destroys 1d6 points of
Armor Class gained from metal armor (to the maximum amount of protection the
armor offered) through corrosion. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Weapons
in use by an opponent targeted by the spell are more difficult to grasp. You
must succeed on a melee touch attack against the weapon. A metal weapon that is
hit is destroyed.</span>

      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Note:
</span>
         </i>
         <span>Striking
at an opponent’s weapon provokes an attack of opportunity. Also, you must touch
the weapon and not the other way around.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Against
a ferrous creature, <i>rusting grasp </i>instantaneously deals 3d6 points of
damage +1 per caster level (maximum +15) per successful attack. The spell lasts
for 1 round per level, and you can make one melee touch attack per round.</span>

opponent attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack the warded creature,
even with a targeted spell, must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, the
opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that casting of the spell. If
the save fails, the opponent can’t follow through with the attack, that part of
its action is lost, and it can’t directly attack the warded creature for the
duration of the spell. Those not attempting to attack the subject remain
unaffected. This spell does not prevent the warded creature from being attacked
or affected by area or effect spells. The subject cannot attack without breaking
the spell but may use nonattack spells or otherwise act.</span>

         <span>This
spell combines several elements to create a powerful protection from scrying
and direct observation. When casting the spell, you dictate what will and will
not be observed in the spell’s area. The illusion created must be stated in
general terms. Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed.</span>

observation may allow a save (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to
disbelieve what is seen. Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion or
necessarily allow a save, assuming that hidden beings take care to stay out of
the way of those affected by the illusion.</span>

trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not age, breathe, grow
hungry, sleep, or regain spells. It is preserved in a state of suspended

         <span>To
use the <i>shadow walk </i>spell, you must be in an area of shadowy
illumination. You and any creature you touch are then transported along a
coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders
the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is
quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your
level limit), but all must be touching each other.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>In
the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally
on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the
Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto
the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto
the Material Plane.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Because
of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane,
you can’t make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during
transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It’s
impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless
for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are
shunted 1d10x100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired
endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted
1d10x1,000 feet in the same direction. If this would still place you within a
solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty
space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued
(no save).</span>

may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the
Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or
abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of

as an area attack, <i>shatter </i>destroys nonmagical objects of crystal,

them resistance to spells cast by chaotic creatures, and <i>slowing </i>chaotic
creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects.</span>

         <span>First,
each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance

a warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against chaotic spells and spells
cast by chaotic creatures.</span>

         <span>Third,
the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as <i>protection

spell wards the subject and creates a mystic connection between you and the
subject so that some of its wounds are transferred to you. The subject gains a
+1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus on saves. Additionally, the
subject takes only half damage from all wounds and attacks (including that
dealt by special abilities) that deal hit point damage. The amount of damage
not taken by the warded creature is taken by you. Forms of harm that do not
involve hit points, such as <i>charm </i>effects, temporary ability damage,
level draining, and death effects, are not affected. If the subject suffers a
reduction of hit points from a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not
split with you because it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends,
subsequent damage is no longer divided between the subject and you, but damage
already split is not reassigned to the subject.</span>

appropriate hit points, feats, skill ranks, and special abilities for a
creature of that level or HD). You can’t create a simulacrum of a creature
whose Hit Dice or levels exceed twice your caster level. You must make a
Disguise check when you cast the spell to determine how good the likeness is. A

snow and melts instantly into nothingness. A complex process requiring at least

      <p>
         <span>This
spell enables you to make a snare that functions as a magic trap. The snare can
be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a rope. When you cast <i>snare </i>upon
it, the cordlike object blends with its surroundings (Search DC 23 for a
character with the trapfinding ability to locate). One end of the snare is tied
in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature
stepping inside the circle.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it. The spell
causes the tree to bend and then straighten when the loop is triggered, dealing
1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting it off the ground by
the trapped limb or limbs. If no such tree is available, the cordlike object
tightens around the creature, dealing no damage but causing it to be entangled.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
snare is magical. To escape, a trapped creature must make a DC 23 Escape Artist
check or a DC 23 Strength check that is a full-round action. The snare has AC 7
and 5 hit points. A successful escape from the snare breaks the loop and ends
the spell.</span>

      <p>
         <span>This
spell functions like <i>fog cloud</i>, but in addition to obscuring sight, the <i>solid
fog </i>is so thick that any creature attempting to move through it progresses
at a speed of 5 feet, regardless of its normal speed, and it takes a −2 penalty
on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged
weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that
falls into <i>solid fog </i>is slowed, so that each 10 feet of vapor that it
passes through reduces falling damage by 1d6. A creature can’t take a 5-foot
step while in <i>solid fog.</i>
         </span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>However,
unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it
does so in 1 round.</span>

         <span>You
grant the semblance of life and intellect to a corpse, allowing it to answer
several questions that you put to it. You may ask one question per two caster
levels. Unasked questions are wasted if the duration expires. The corpse’s
knowledge is limited to what the creature knew during life, including the
languages it spoke (if any). Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive.
If the creature’s alignment was different from yours, the corpse gets a Will
save to resist the spell as if it were alive.</span>

         <span>If
the corpse has been subject to <i>speak with dead </i>within the past week, the

corpse, however, cannot learn new information.</span>

   <description>
      <p>
         <span>A
ghostly, glowing hand shaped from your life force materializes and moves as you
desire, allowing you to deliver low-level, touch range spells at a distance. On
casting the spell, you lose 1d4 hit points that return when the spell ends
(even if it is dispelled), but not if the hand is destroyed. (The hit points
can be healed as normal.) For as long as the spell lasts, any touch range spell
of 4th level or lower that you cast can be delivered by the <i>spectral hand</i>.
The spell gives you a +2 bonus on your melee touch attack roll, and attacking
with the hand counts normally as an attack. The hand always strikes from your
direction. The hand cannot flank targets like a creature can. After it delivers
a spell, or if the hand goes beyond the spell range, goes out of your sight,
the hand returns to you and hovers.</span>

         <span>The
hand is incorporeal and thus cannot be harmed by normal weapons. It has
improved evasion (half damage on a failed Reflex save and no damage on a
successful save), your save bonuses, and an AC of at least 22. Your
Intelligence modifier applies to the hand’s AC as if it were the hand’s
Dexterity modifier. The hand has 1 to 4 hit points, the same number that you
lost in creating it.</span>

effectively has unbeatable spell resistance regarding the specified spell or

in this manner. The subject gains a climb speed of 20 feet; furthermore, it
need not make Climb checks to traverse a vertical or horizontal surface (even
upside down). A <i>spider climbing </i>creature retains its Dexterity bonus to
Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to
their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while
climbing.</span>

   <description>
      <p>
         <span>A
weapon made of pure force springs into existence and attacks opponents at a
distance, as you direct it, dealing 1d8 force damage per hit, +1 point per
three caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The weapon takes the shape of a
weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or
symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat range and critical
multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you
designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and
continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus
(possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus
your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a
weapon, so, for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As
a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the normal miss
chance associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your
direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your
feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the
spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the
weapon returns to you and hovers.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Each
round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a
new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round’s
target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack.
Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple
attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the <i>spiritual
weapon </i>is a ranged weapon, use the spell’s range, not the weapon’s normal
range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>A
<i>spiritual weapon </i>cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <i>dispel
magic</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i>rod of
cancellation </i>affects it. A <i>spiritual weapon</i>’s AC against touch
attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object).</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20
+ caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the <i>spiritual
weapon </i>strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is
dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for
the duration of the spell.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity’s own personal
weapon. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment. A
neutral cleric without a deity can create a <i>spiritual weapon </i>of any
alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that
alignment at the time. The weapons associated with each alignment are as
follows.</span>

Summon Monster table. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can
change that choice each time you cast the spell.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>A
summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can
it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be
summoned into an environment that cannot support them.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>When
you use a summoning spell to summon an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good,
lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.</span>

         <span>This
spell summons a natural creature. It appears where you designate and acts
immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its
ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to
attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.</span>

         <span>A
summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can
it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be
summoned into an environment that cannot support them.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st-level list on the accompanying
Summon Nature’s Ally table. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and
you can change that choice each time you cast the spell. All the creatures on
the table are neutral unless otherwise noted.</span>

   <description>
      <p>
         <span>This
spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When
triggered, a <i>symbol of death </i>slays one or more creatures within 60 feet
of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not
exceed 150. The <i>symbol of death </i>affects the closest creatures first,
skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the <i>symbol
</i>becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until
it has affected 150 hit points’ worth of creatures, whichever comes first. Any
creature that enters the area while the <i>symbol of death </i>is active is
subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was
triggered. A creature need save against the <i>symbol </i>only once as long as
it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the <i>symbol
</i>is still active, it must save again.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Until
it is triggered, the <i>symbol of death </i>is inactive (though visible and
legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a <i>symbol of death </i>must
always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding
the rune renders the <i>symbol of death </i>ineffective, unless a creature
removes the covering, in which case the <i>symbol of death </i>works normally.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>As
a default, a <i>symbol of death </i>is triggered whenever a creature does one
or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune;
touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the
rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than
60 feet from a symbol of death can’t trigger it (even if it meets one or more
of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is
cast, a <i>symbol of death</i>’s triggering conditions cannot be changed.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>In
this case, “reading” the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or
fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a <i>symbol of death </i>to render it
inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can’t use a <i>symbol
of death </i>offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death
remains untriggered if an item bearing the <i>symbol of death </i>is used to
touch a creature. Likewise, a <i>symbol of death </i>cannot be placed on a
weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple
or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a <i>symbol of
death </i>can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or alignment, but
otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as
level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don’t qualify. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>When
scribing a <i>symbol of death</i>, you can specify a password or phrase that
prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect<i>. </i>Anyone using
the password remains immune to that particular rune’s effects so long as the
creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius
and returns later, it must use the password again.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
also can attune any number of creatures to the <i>symbol of death, </i>but
doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes
negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends
the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five
creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer.
Any creature attuned to a <i>symbol of death </i>cannot trigger it and is
immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered. You are
automatically considered attuned to your own <i>symbols of death</i>, and thus
always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Read
magic </span>
         </i>
         <span>allows
you to identify a <i>symbol of death </i>with a DC 19 Spellcraft check. Of
course, if the <i>symbol of death </i>is set to be triggered by reading it,
this will trigger the symbol.</span>
      </p>
      <p>

         <span>You
move objects or creatures by concentrating on them. Depending on the version
selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of
combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust.</span>

      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Sustained
Force: </span>
         </i>
         <span>A
sustained force moves an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster
level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature
can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or
with spell resistance.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>This
version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you
cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in
both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if
the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any
reason, the object falls or stops.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>An
object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a
lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on,
if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able
to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require
Intelligence checks.</span>

            <span>Combat
Maneuver: </span>
         </i>
         <span>Alternatively,
once per round, you can use <i>telekinesis </i>to perform a bull rush, disarm,
grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that
they don’t provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place
of your base attack bonus (for disarm and grapple), you use your Intelligence
modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your
Strength or Dexterity modifier, and a failed attempt doesn’t allow a reactive
attempt by the target (such as for disarm or trip). No save is allowed against
these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the
spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease
concentration.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Violent
Thrust: </span>
         </i>
         <span>Alternatively,
the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or
creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10
feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the
objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level
(maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the
target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence
modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause
standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage
as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage
ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points
of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects).</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Creatures
who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are
allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those
whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a telekinesed creature is
hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet
(1d6 points).</span>

         <span>This
spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as
distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You
can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed your maximum
load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature
(carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below)
per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a
Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be
transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those
creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is
personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell
resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another
person receive saving throws and spell resistance.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The
clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of
strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even
impossible.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>To
see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the Teleport table.
Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.</span>

            <span>Familiarity:
</span>
         </i>
         <span>“Very
familiar” is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home.
“Studied carefully” is a place you know well, either because you can currently
see it, you’ve been there often, or you have used other means (such as <i>scrying</i>)
to study the place for at least one hour. “Seen casually” is a place that you
have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. “Viewed
once” is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>“False
destination” is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to
an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so
completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a
false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than
rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or
even be off target from.</span>

         <i>
            <span>Off Target: </span>
         </i>
         <span>You
appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random
direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be
traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly</span>
      </p>
      <p>

you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists

anyone else teleporting with you have gotten “scrambled.” You each take 1d10
points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For
these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time “Mishap” comes up, the characters take
more damage and must reroll.</span>

spell functions like <i>teleport, </i>except that there is no range limit and
there is no chance you arrive off target. In addition, you need not have seen
the destination, but in that case you must have at least a reliable description
of the place to which you are teleporting. If you attempt to teleport with
insufficient information (or with misleading information), you disappear and
simply reappear in your original location. Interplanar travel is not possible.</span>

      <p>
         <span>You
create a circle on the floor or other horizontal surface that teleports, as <i>greater
teleport, </i>any creature who stands on it to a designated spot. Once you
designate the destination for the circle, you can’t change it. The spell fails
if you attempt to set the circle to teleport creatures into a solid object, to
a place with which you are not familiar and have no clear description, or to
another plane.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
circle itself is subtle and nearly impossible to notice. If you intend to keep
creatures from activating it accidentally, you need to mark the circle in some
way.</span>

triggered again as normal.</span>

traps such as <i>teleportation circle </i>are hard to detect and disable. A
rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find the circle and Disable Device to
thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 34 in the case of <i>teleportation
circle</i>.</span>

create a slightly concave, circular plane of force that follows you about and
carries loads for you. The disk is 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch deep at its
center. It can hold 100 pounds of weight per caster level. (If used to
transport a liquid, its capacity is 2 gallons.) The disk floats approximately 3
feet above the ground at all times and remains level. It floats along
horizontally within spell range and will accompany you at a rate of no more
than your normal speed each round. If not otherwise directed, it maintains a
constant interval of 5 feet between itself and you. The disk winks out of
existence when the spell duration expires. The disk also winks out if you move
beyond range or try to take the disk more than 3 feet away from the surface
beneath it. When the disk winks out, whatever it was supporting falls to the
surface beneath it.</span>

         <span>This
spell turns natural, uncut or unworked rock of any sort into an equal volume of
mud. Magical stone is not affected by the spell. The depth of the mud created
cannot exceed 10 feet. A creature unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free
itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its speed to 5 feet
and causing a −2 penalty on attack rolls and AC. Brush thrown atop the mud can
support creatures able to climb on top of it. Creatures large enough to walk on
the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5 feet.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
<i>transmute rock to mud </i>is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel,
the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool at a depth of 5 feet. The
falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to
anyone caught directly beneath the area, or half damage to those who succeed on
Reflex saves.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Castles
and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect of the spell,
since <i>transmute rock to mud </i>can’t affect worked stone and doesn’t reach
deep enough to undermine such buildings’ foundations. However, small buildings
or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even
partially toppled by this spell.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The
mud remains until a successful <i>dispel magic </i>or <i>transmute mud to rock </i>spell
restores its substance—but not necessarily its form. Evaporation turns the mud
to normal dirt over a period of days. The exact time depends on exposure to the
sun, wind, and normal drainage.</span>

         <i>
            <span>Trap
the soul </span>
         </i>
         <span>forces
a creature’s life force (and its material body) into a gem. The gem holds the
trapped entity indefinitely or until the gem is broken and the life force is
released, which allows the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is
a powerful creature from another plane it can be required to perform a service
immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem
imprisoning it is broken.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Depending
on the version selected, the spell can be triggered in one of two ways.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Spell
Completion: </span>
         </i>
         <span>First,
the spell can be completed by speaking its final word as a standard action as
if you were casting a regular spell at the subject. This allows spell
resistance (if any) and a Will save to avoid the effect. If the creature’s name
is spoken as well, any spell resistance is ignored and the save DC increases by
2. If the save or spell resistance is successful, the gem shatters.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Trigger
Object: </span>
         </i>
         <span>The
second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a
trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the
creature’s soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature’s name and
the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is
enspelled. A <i>sympathy </i>spell can also be placed on the trigger object. As
soon as the subject picks up or accepts the trigger object, its life force is
automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of spell resistance or
a save.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Focus
(Trigger Object Only): </span>
         </i>
         <span>If the trigger object method is used, a special trigger
object, prepared as described above, is needed.</span>
      </p>
   </description>
   <material>Before
the actual casting of <i>trap the soul, </i>you must procure a gem of at least
1,000 gp value for every Hit Die possessed by the creature to be trapped. If
the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the entrapment is attempted.
(While creatures have no concept of level or Hit Dice as such, the value of the
gem needed to trap an individual can be researched. Remember that this value
can change over time as creatures gain more Hit Dice.)</material>

the site or structure is guarded by a <i>magic circle against good </i>effect.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Second,
all turning checks made to turn undead take a −4 penalty, and turning checks to
rebuke undead gain a +4 profane bonus. Spell resistance does not apply to this
effect. (This provision does not apply to the druid version of the spell.)</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Finally,
you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the <i>unhallowed </i>site. The
spell effect lasts for one year and functions throughout the entire site,
regardless of its normal duration and area or effect. You may designate whether
the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that share your faith or
alignment, or creatures that adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end
of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply
by casting <i>unhallow </i>again.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Spell
effects that may be tied to an <i>unhallowed </i>site include <i>aid, bane,
bless, cause fear, darkness, daylight, death ward, deeper darkness, detect
magic, detect good, dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure
elements, freedom of movement, invisibility purge, protection from energy,
remove fear, resist energy, silence, tongues, </i>and <i>zone of truth</i>.</span>

         <span>Saving

creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects.</span>

      <p>
         <span>First,
each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance
bonus on saves. Unlike the effect of <i>protection from good</i>, this benefit
applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by good creatures.</span>

the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as <i>protection

<i>unseen servant </i>is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs
simple tasks at your command. It can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors,
and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. The servant can perform only one
activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if
told to do so as long as you remain within range. It can open only normal
doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It has an effective Strength score of 2 (so
it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds). It can trigger traps and such, but
it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain
pressure plates and other devices. It can’t perform any task that requires a
skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill
that can’t be used untrained. Its speed is 15 feet.</span>
      </p>

         <span>The
servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll. It cannot
be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks.
(It gets no saves against attacks.) If you attempt to send it beyond the
spell’s range (measured from your current position), the servant ceases to
exist.</span>

      <p>
         <span>This
spell creates an anchored plane of ice or a hemisphere of ice, depending on the
version selected. A <i>wall of ice </i>cannot form in an area occupied by
physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when
created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a
Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates
that the spell automatically fails. Fire can melt a <i>wall of ice, </i>and it
deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by
objects). Suddenly melting a <i>wall of ice </i>creates a great cloud of steamy
fog that lasts for 10 minutes.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>
            <span>Ice
Plane: </span>
         </i>
         <span>A
sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level.
It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard
can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long
and 20 feet high, or some other combination of length and height that does not
exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as
it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a
horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Each
10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can
hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is
breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack,
the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Even
when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any
creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall)
takes 1d6 points of cold damage +1 point per caster level (no save).</span>

         <span>The wall
takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per

      <p>
         <span>You
cause a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into being. The wall inserts itself
into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The
wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or
another object. It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges
to fit the available space.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>A
<i>wall of iron </i>is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. You can double the
wall’s area by halving its thickness. Each 5- foot square of the wall has 30
hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10. A section of wall whose hit
points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall
with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of
thickness.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>If
you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but
not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush
creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left
unpushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it
fall randomly. A creature must make a DC 40 Strength check to push the wall
over. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making
successful Reflex saves. Any Large or smaller creature that fails takes 10d6 points
of damage. The wall cannot crush Huge and larger creatures.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Like
any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural
phenomena.</span>

         <span>This
spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. A <i>wall
of stone </i>is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one
5-foot square per level. You can double the wall’s area by halving its
thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a
creature or another object.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Unlike
a <i>wall of iron, </i>you can create a <i>wall of stone </i>in almost any
shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm
foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing
stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this
use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed.
This requirement reduces the spell’s area by half. The wall can be crudely
shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing
the area.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Like
any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a <i>disintegrate </i>spell
or by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of the
wall has 15 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 8. A section of wall
whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through
the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch
of thickness.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>It
is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a <i>wall
of stone</i>, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures.
Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.</span>

   <description>
      <p>
         <span>A
<i>wall of thorns </i>spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled
brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a human’s finger. Any creature
forced into or attempting to move through a <i>wall of thorns </i>takes
slashing damage per round of movement equal to 25 minus the creature’s AC.
Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation. (Creatures
with an Armor Class of 25 or higher, without considering Dexterity and dodge
bonuses, take no damage from contact with the wall.)</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall
as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level. This
has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to
break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Creatures
can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a
full-round action. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature
moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed). Of
course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as
described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain
motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Any
creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had
moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt
to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the
ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a <i>wall
of thorns </i>at normal speed without taking damage.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>A
<i>wall of thorns </i>can be breached by slow work with edged weapons. Chopping
away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of
work. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10
minutes.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Despite
its appearance, a <i>wall of thorns </i>is not actually a living plant, and
thus is unaffected by spells that affect plants.</span>

are useless. A warped melee weapon causes a −4 penalty on attack rolls.</span>

         <span>creates a
many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands. These strands trap those caught in
them. The strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. These
masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points
or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a
<i>web </i>become entangled among the gluey fibers. Attacking a creature in a
web won’t cause you to become entangled.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Anyone
in the effect’s area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this
save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though
moving is more difficult than normal for being entangled (see below). If the
save fails, the creature is entangled and can’t move from its space, but can
break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25
Escape Artist check. Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a
later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature remains entangled, but
may move through the <i>web </i>very slowly. Each round devoted to moving
allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check. The
creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds
10.</span>

strands of a <i>web </i>spell are flammable. A magic <i>flaming sword </i>can

wind </i>to move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10
minutes.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>When
the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains in place until the
message is delivered. As with <i>magic mouth, whispering wind </i>cannot speak
verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.</span>

         <span>You
alter the substance of your body to a cloudlike vapor (as the <i>gaseous form </i>spell)
and move through the air, possibly at great speed. You can take other creatures
with you, each of which acts independently.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Normally,
a <i>wind walker </i>flies at a speed of 10 feet with perfect maneuverability.
If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a <i>wind walker </i>along at
up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with poor maneuverability. <i>Wind walkers </i>are
not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in
white, they are 80% likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>A
<i>wind walker </i>can regain its physical form as desired and later resume the
cloud form. Each change to and from vaporous form takes 5 rounds, which counts
toward the duration of the spell (as does any time spent in physical form). As
noted above, you can dismiss the spell, and you can even dismiss it for
individual wind walkers and not others.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>For
the last minute of the spell’s duration, a <i>wind walker </i>in cloud form
automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though it
may descend faster if it wishes. This descent serves as a warning that the
spell is about to end.</span>

         <span>An
invisible vertical curtain of wind appears. It is 2 feet thick and of
considerable strength. It is a roaring blast sufficient to blow away any bird
smaller than an eagle, or tear papers and similar materials from unsuspecting
hands. (A Reflex save allows a creature to maintain its grasp on an object.)
Tiny and Small flying creatures cannot pass through the barrier. Loose
materials and cloth garments fly upward when caught in a <i>wind wall. </i>Arrows
and bolts are deflected upward and miss, while any other normal ranged weapon
passing through the wall has a 30% miss chance. (A giant-thrown boulder, a
siege engine projectile, and other massive ranged weapons are not affected.)
Gases, most gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in gaseous form cannot pass
through the wall (although it is no barrier to incorporeal creatures).</span>

      <p>
         <span>While
the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in any continuous path along the

         <i>
            <span>Wish
</span>
         </i>
         <span>is the
mightiest spell a wizard or sorcerer can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you
can alter reality to better suit you.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Even
<i>wish</i>, however, has its limits.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>A
<i>wish </i>can produce any one of the following effects.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>· </span>
         <span>Duplicate any wizard or
sorcerer spell of 8th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school
prohibited to you.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>· </span>
         <span>Duplicate any other spell
of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>· </span>
         <span>Duplicate any wizard or
sorcerer spell of 7th level or lower even if it’s of a prohibited school.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>· </span>
         <span>Duplicate any other spell
of 5th level or lower even if it’s of a prohibited school. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>· </span>
         <span>Undo the harmful effects
of many other spells, such as <i>geas/quest </i>or <i>insanity</i>.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>· </span>
         <span>Create a nonmagical item
of up to 25,000 gp in value.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>· </span>
         <span>Create a magic item, or
add to the powers of an existing magic item.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>· </span>
         <span>Grant a creature a +1
inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five <i>wish </i>spells cast in
immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an
ability score (two wishes for a +2 inherent bonus, three for a +3 inherent
bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be
dispelled. <i>Note: </i>An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single
ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack,
so only the best one applies.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>· </span>
         <span>Remove injuries and
afflictions. A single <i>wish </i>can aid one creature per caster level, and
all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could
heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison
effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same <i>wish</i>.
A <i>wish </i>can never restore the experience point loss from casting a spell
or the level or Constitution loss from being raised from the dead.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>· </span>
         <span>Revive the dead. A <i>wish
</i>can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a <i>resurrection </i>spell.
A <i>wish </i>can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the
task takes two <i>wishes, </i>one to recreate the body and another to infuse
the body with life again. A <i>wish </i>cannot prevent a character who was
brought back to life from losing an experience level.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>· </span>
         <span>Transport travelers. A <i>wish
</i>can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place
those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An
unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance
(if any) applies.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>· </span>
         <span>Undo misfortune. A <i>wish
</i>can undo a single recent event. The <i>wish </i>forces a reroll of any roll
made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself
to accommodate the new result. For example, a <i>wish </i>could undo an
opponent’s successful save, a foe’s successful critical hit (either the attack
roll or the critical roll), a friend’s failed save, and so on. The reroll,
however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target
gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>You
may try to use a <i>wish </i>to produce greater effects than these, but doing
so is dangerous. (The <i>wish </i>may pervert your intent into a literal but
undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment.)</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>Duplicated
spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal (but save DCs are for
9th-level spells).</span>
      </p>
   </description>
   <material>When a <i>wish </i>duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component.</material>
   <xpcost>The
minimum XP cost for casting <i>wish </i>is 5,000 XP. When a <i>wish </i>duplicates
a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay 5,000 XP or that cost, whichever is
more. When a <i>wish </i>creates or improves a magic item, you must pay twice
the normal XP cost for crafting or improving the item, plus an additional 5,000
XP.</xpcost>

A barbarian can fly into a rage a certain number of times per day. In a rage, a barbarian temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but he takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase in Constitution increases the barbarian’s hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the rage when his Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are.) While raging, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate, and Ride), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to function. He can use any feat he has except Combat Expertise, item creation feats, and metamagic feats. A fit of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character’s (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A barbarian may prematurely end his rage. At the end of the rage, the barbarian loses the rage modifiers and restrictions and becomes fatigued (-2 penalty to Strength, -2 penalty to Dexterity, can’t charge or run) for the duration of the current encounter (unless he is a 17th-level barbarian, at which point this limitation no longer applies).
